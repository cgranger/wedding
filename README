A simple little django-powered website for my upcoming wedding.  This mainly serves as a
little tutorial and learning project for django.  I come from php and a bit of ruby on rails
so need an easy project to pick up the basics.

The project is slated to support the following at a minimum:

- Guests can rsvp to wedding
- Show maps to wedding/reception sites
- Blog about wedding news/planning
- Allow comments from non-registered users on blog posts
- Allow back-end updating of the majority of the pages instead of static HTML
- Send e-mail to specified account when rsvp is received

- Currently working admin site with django rev. 9964 of the 1.0.x branch

TODO:
- Fix validation errors on rsvp/contact form
- Look into django photo galleries
- Generate a list/total of all current rsvps
- Make 'editing' previous rsvp a bit more obvious
- Something to send out e-mails when something changes
- RSS feed
- Custom template tag for 'latest updates'
- Add some pictures
- Add comments
- Add natalie to e-mails from rsvp/contact
- Get date/time/location for rsvp e-mail
- Verify e-mail sending for rsvp/contact us work
- Setup analytics (hosting or google)
