A simple little django-powered website for my upcoming wedding.  This mainly serves as a
little tutorial and learning project for django.  I come from php and a bit of ruby on rails
so need an easy project to pick up the basics.

The project is slated to support the following at a minimum:

- Guests can rsvp to wedding
- Show maps to wedding/reception sites
- Blog about wedding news/planning
- Allow comments from non-registered users on blog posts
- Allow back-end updating of the majority of the pages instead of static HTML
- Send e-mail to specified account when rsvp is received

- Currently working admin site with django rev. 9964 of the 1.0.x branch

TODO:
- Validate all pages
- Validate css
- Test on existing host
- Look into django photo galleries
- Hook up mysql/postgres?
- Test in diff. browsers (IE, Safari)
- Add html/css validator icons
- Add credit for images
